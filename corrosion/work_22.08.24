[1;36mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source tool for network exploration and security[m
       auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against[m
       single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are[m
       available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are[m
       offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet[m
       filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is[m
       commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it[m
       useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules,[m
       and monitoring host or service uptime.[m
[m
       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each[m
       depending on the options used. Key among that information is the "interesting ports[m
       table".  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The[m
       state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application[m
       on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.  Filtered means[m
       that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap[m
       cannot tell whether it is open or closed.  Closed ports have no application listening on[m
       them, though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered when[m
       they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or[m
       closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered when it[m
       cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also[m
       include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP[m
       protocol scan is requested ([1;36m-sO[0m), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols[m
       rather than listening ports.[m
[m
       In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on[m
       targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC[m
       addresses.[m

  -iR <num hosts>: Choose random targets
  --exclude <host1[,host2][,host3],...>: Exclude hosts/networks
  --excludefile <exclude_file>: Exclude list from file
HOST DISCOVERY:
  -sL: List Scan - simply list targets to scan
  -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan
  -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
  -PS/PA/PU/PY[portlist]: TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports
  -PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes
  -PO[protocol list]: IP Protocol Ping
  -n/-R: Never do DNS resolution/Always resolve [default: sometimes]
  --dns-servers <serv1[,serv2],...>: Specify custom DNS servers
  --system-dns: Use OS's DNS resolver
  --traceroute: Trace hop path to each host
SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
  -sU: UDP Scan
  -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
  --scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
  -sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
  -sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
  -sO: IP protocol scan
  -b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan
PORT SPECIFICATION AND SCAN ORDER:
  -p <port ranges>: Only scan specified ports
    Ex: -p22; -p1-65535; -p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080,S:9
  --exclude-ports <port ranges>: Exclude the specified ports from scanning
  -F: Fast mode - Scan fewer ports than the default scan
  -r: Scan ports consecutively - don't randomize
  --top-ports <number>: Scan <number> most common ports
  --port-ratio <ratio>: Scan ports more common than <ratio>
SERVICE/VERSION DETECTION:
  -sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
  --version-intensity <level>: Set from 0 (light) to 9 (try all probes)
  --version-light: Limit to most likely probes (intensity 2)
  --version-all: Try every single probe (intensity 9)
  --version-trace: Show detailed version scan activity (for debugging)
SCRIPT SCAN:
  -sC: equivalent to --script=default
  --script=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts> is a comma separated list of
           directories, script-files or script-categories
  --script-args=<n1=v1,[n2=v2,...]>: provide arguments to scripts
  --script-args-file=filename: provide NSE script args in a file
  --script-trace: Show all data sent and received
  --script-updatedb: Update the script database.
  --script-help=<Lua scripts>: Show help about scripts.
           <Lua scripts> is a comma-separated list of script-files or
           script-categories.
OS DETECTION:
  -O: Enable OS detection
  --osscan-limit: Limit OS detection to promising targets
  --osscan-guess: Guess OS more aggressively
TIMING AND PERFORMANCE:
  Options which take <time> are in seconds, or append 'ms' (milliseconds),
  's' (seconds), 'm' (minutes), or 'h' (hours) to the value (e.g. 30m).
  -T<0-5>: Set timing template (higher is faster)
  --min-hostgroup/max-hostgroup <size>: Parallel host scan group sizes
  --min-parallelism/max-parallelism <numprobes>: Probe parallelization
  --min-rtt-timeout/max-rtt-timeout/initial-rtt-timeout <time>: Specifies
      probe round trip time.
  --max-retries <tries>: Caps number of port scan probe retransmissions.
  --host-timeout <time>: Give up on target after this long
  --scan-delay/--max-scan-delay <time>: Adjust delay between probes
  --min-rate <number>: Send packets no slower than <number> per second
  --max-rate <number>: Send packets no faster than <number> per second
FIREWALL/IDS EVASION AND SPOOFING:
  -f; --mtu <val>: fragment packets (optionally w/given MTU)
  -D <decoy1,decoy2[,ME],...>: Cloak a scan with decoys
  -S <IP_Address>: Spoof source address
  -e <iface>: Use specified interface
  -g/--source-port <portnum>: Use given port number
  --proxies <url1,[url2],...>: Relay connections through HTTP/SOCKS4 proxies
  --data <hex string>: Append a custom payload to sent packets
  --data-string <string>: Append a custom ASCII string to sent packets
  --data-length <num>: Append random data to sent packets

[1;36mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source tool for network exploration and security[m
       auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against[m
       single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are[m
       available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are[m
       offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet[m
       filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is[m
       commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it[m
       useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules,[m
       and monitoring host or service uptime.[m
[m
       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each[m
       depending on the options used. Key among that information is the "interesting ports[m
       table".  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The[m
       state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application[m
       on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.  Filtered means[m
       that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap[m
       cannot tell whether it is open or closed.  Closed ports have no application listening on[m
       them, though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered when[m
       they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or[m
       closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered when it[m
       cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also[m
       include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP[m
       protocol scan is requested ([1;36m-sO[0m), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols[m
       rather than listening ports.[m
[m
       In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on[m
       targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC[m
       addresses.[m

[1;36mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open source tool for network exploration and security[m
       auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against[m
       single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are[m
       available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are[m
       offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet[m
       filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is[m
       commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it[m
       useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules,[m
       and monitoring host or service uptime.[m
[m
       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each[m
       depending on the options used. Key among that information is the "interesting ports[m
       table".  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The[m
       state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application[m
       on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.  Filtered means[m
       that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap[m
       cannot tell whether it is open or closed.  Closed ports have no application listening on[m
       them, though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered when[m
       they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or[m
       closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered when it[m
       cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also[m
       include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP[m
       protocol scan is requested ([1;36m-sO[0m), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols[m
       rather than listening ports.[m
[m
       In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on[m
       targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC[m
       addresses.[m
